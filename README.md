# Building and Running this Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running in Development Mode

Running this application in development mode is simple. 

* Make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed. Yarn is also helpful to run the react scripts.
* Install the node_modules by running either `npm install` or `yarn install`
* After all of the node_modules are installed, you can start the application with `npm start` or `yarn start`

The following are some detailed explanations of the react scripts provided the the create-react-app team:
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
